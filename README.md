# Weaviate.NET
This library is designed to wrap [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) vector DB  for .NET core. The core API has been wrapped with *NSwagStudio* and then some extra layer has been added. The API mapping is incomplete and Unit tests should be generalized (they currently use a demo instance).
